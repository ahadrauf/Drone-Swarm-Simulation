# Drone Swarm Simulation

This application works to simulate drone swarm behavior in response to common group maneuver patterns. It uses a C++ backend to parallelize drone movement calculations across multiple threads, as well as a Java frontend for visualization.

The currently supported movement patterns are:
* Circling/hovering around a specified target within a certain minimum and maximum range
*	Doing the above while maintaining a specified angular range of movement (for example, only circling between 0 degrees and 180 degrees when viewed from the top down)
*	Returning to a central base location when battery is low for repair (battery consumption is calculated in `Drone.cpp` if you're curious about the exact calculations)

In addition, all movement is combined with obstacle avoidance and compensation for external wind speed. Currently, movement is calculated using a proportional controller, which works fairly well for most movement patterns. However, the steady state error for maneuvers tends to be a bit larger occasionally, so in the future a more comprehensive PI or alternative control model could be looked into (see `World.cpp` if you're curious about the details).

## Using the Software
For reference, the C++ backend is executed by `DroneSwarmSimulation.sln` and drawing from the files in the `\DroneSwarmSimulation` folder, and the Java code is contained in the `\DroneSwarmSimulation\DroneSwarmGUI` folder.

Tasks are given by the `Source.cpp` file in the `\DroneSwarmSimulation` folder, simulating a central base station that assigns multiple tasks of varying priorities to the drone. In the nature of swarm robotics, each drone autonomously decides which task to execute based on its surrounding conditions, analyzing its distance to the target locations as well as the respective priority of each task to optimize how many drones are assigned to each task. This is done using a conventional cost function minimization approach (see `World.cpp` and `Drone.cpp` for the specifics).

## Demo
A demo for the software can be found here: https://youtu.be/I5n_QFn6ilc. It shows several operations conducted by 100 drones on 4 targets, including multi-target tracking, obstacle avoidance, 360Â° surveillance, and returning to home.
